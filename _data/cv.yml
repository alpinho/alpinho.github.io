        - "My PhD Project was focused on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying musical creativity within the framework of musical performance. I’ve used musical improvisation as a model behaviour and <i>functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</i> (fMRI) as a technique in order to access the correspondent brain activity in professional pianists."
        - title: Study I sought to investigate the specific neurocognitive effects derived from expertise in musical improvisation. Results show a significant negative association between improvisational training and activity in a number of cortical regions in the right hemisphere. Besides, more experienced improvisers showed higher functional connectivity during improvisation between prefrontal, premotor, and motor regions.

        - title: Study II explored the contribution of the <i>Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex</i> (DLPFC) in creative cognition. Main findings highlight that deliberative creative cognition can be implemented in different ways given different circumstances. Higher activity was registered in the right DLPFC as well as in the parietal lobe and right dorsal premotor cortex, when contrasting structural conditions with emotional conditions. Conversely, the DLPFC was functionally connected to the default mode network during emotional conditions.

      description:
        - My main project in this fellowship pertains to the functional mapping of the cortico-striatal-cerebellar circuitry involved in the cognitive ability of forming temporal predictions during rhythmic and non-rhythmic sequences of events. 
        - I am also interested on the development of encoding models of cognitive tasks as means to improve functional specificity in neuroimaging and, to this end, I am studying how to combine task-fMRI data across different datasets that will allow us to improve specificity of the statistical results relative to elementary cognitive components that modulate behavior.

        - title: I was involved in the development of the <i>Individual Brain Charting</i> (IBC) dataset, which refers to an open-access neuroimaging initiative concerning the acquisition and analysis of multitask fMRI data for the establishment of a neurocognitive atlas of the human brain. This project is part of the <i>Human Brain Project</i> consortium.

        - title: Because many fMRI studies are limited to one single task and only report group-average brain maps that hinder effect specificity and a fine demarcation of brain regions, I also developed an individual-functional-atlasing approach to link functional segregation of specialized brain regions to elementary mental functions, by leveraging the IBC dataset.
