I am a Cognitive Neuroscientist with a background in Engineering Physics. My research combines <i>functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</i> (fMRI), computational modeling, and statistical analysis to investigate how complex mental functions are represented in the human brain. Alongside these scientific questions, I develop methods for functional atlasing, creating individualized maps of brain function that link neural activity to behavior across tasks and people. I have explored many psychological domains, including music paradigms to study creativity, improvisation, motor preparation, and timing. Overall, my work builds bridges between cognitive neuroscience, data science, and open research practices to advance reproducible and personalized brain mapping.
