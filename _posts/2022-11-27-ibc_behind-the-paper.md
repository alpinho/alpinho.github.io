Back in 2020, when <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00670-4">the second <i>Individual Brain Charting</i> data paper</a> was published, I wrote a blog post for "Springer Nature - Research Data Community" describing the origins of the project, main motivations and its predecessors. You can read it <a href="https://researchdata.springernature.com/posts/the-individual-brain-charting-project">here</a>.
