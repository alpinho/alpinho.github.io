annotate = {* This paper introduces several key experiments on a fraction of the IBC dataset, namely the first release. In particular, it introduces the application of dictionary learning to summarize contrast maps to topographies. It studies the stability of the dictionary components across data resamplings. It also shows that some contrast maps can be successfully reconstructed from other contrasts. Finally, it illustrates how the accumulation of functional contrasts can help to distinguish between the functional specialization of several regions taken from the language network.}
